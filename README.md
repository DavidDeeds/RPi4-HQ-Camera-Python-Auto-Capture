Uses PIL (Pillow) and tkinter python libraries to:

Take one second (customisable) snapshots of whatever the Raspberry PI HQ camera is looking at,
Save to disk with a unique filename and,
Display the image for a short while (customisable) before proceeding.
You may need to install the Python Image Library (PIL - Pillow) and tkinter for this to work on your Raspberry Pi OS.

I have put an image file of my Raspberry Pi 4 with High Quality (HQ) Camera attached using a custom mounting plate for tripod or hanging use that this code is used on.

You can find the camera mount here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4601313

This is the camera module I am using on my Rasp PI 4: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/
